## 📂 Assignments & Tasks

### 1️⃣ Percolation

**Description**  
Simulates a percolation system using an `N × N` grid and determines whether the
system percolates using the **Union-Find** data structure.

**Files**

- `Percolation.java`

**Key Concepts**

- Dynamic connectivity
- Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Statistical analysis (mean, stddev, confidence interval)
